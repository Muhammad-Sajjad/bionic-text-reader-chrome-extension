BIONIC TEXT READER EXTENSION ICONS

This directory contains files to help you generate the required icons for the Chrome extension.

REQUIRED ICONS:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

HOW TO GENERATE THE ICONS:
1. Open the 'generate_icons.html' file in a web browser
2. The page will automatically display the icons
3. Right-click on each icon and select "Save Image As..."
4. Save each icon with its corresponding name (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png)
5. Make sure to save them in this directory

ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
If you prefer, you can also use the SVG files provided:
- icon16.svg
- icon48.svg
- icon128.svg

These SVG files can be converted to PNG using any image editing software or online converters.

NOTE:
The manifest.json file requires these icons to be in PNG format. The extension will not work properly without these icons.
